                #COMPLETE # page 1: TRACKLIST is every tracked player in following format                    

                #COMPLETE page 2: S(#season)B is every tournament in following format

                page 3: S(#season)C is every tracked player in following format
                    Player  |   Notable placements  |   Notable Wins    |   Losses
                Notable placements color format is event tier color

                    Oops forgot i needed the sets of the tournaments for page 3 and 4. Create get sets query of all valid tournaments
                    for now, filter only for the tracked players and only on countign tournaments
                    proceed with page 3 after this

                notes: top cut is an aggregate of tracked players chosen to go into it
