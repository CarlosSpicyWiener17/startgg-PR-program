#Wiener PR Helper

Just a simple program to get all tournaments in a geographic area,
get its entrants, track notable players, and generate an xlsx file showing
Tracked Players, Bracket Results, Contender Results, complete H2H
It does this by querying startgg

You can give events tiers, choose wether or not it counts for PR,
it has clickable links aswell

You can easily untrack players, or add in events that were missed by the program

Contender results and H2H have an approximate sorting based on results

**Planned:**
Custom tiering settings
Custom location filtering based on distance
Choosable country location (+states for the US)
Filtering based on TOs
Full playerlist with searchable/filtering on approximate results

**Usage**
You need a start.gg developer token in auth.txt in the same location as the .exe\n
You also need to make a folder in user Documents called "Wiener Exports"
